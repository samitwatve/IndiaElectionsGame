India Elections Game - How to Run
==================================

1. Extract the zip file so you have a folder named `India_Elections_Game` with all files and folders inside.

2. Try double-clicking `index.html` to open the game in your web browser.

3. If the game does not work (for example, if you see errors or a blank screen), run a simple local server:

   a. Make sure you have Python installed (most computers do).

   b. Open the `India_Elections_Game` folder in File Explorer.

   c. In the address bar at the top, type `cmd` and press Enter. This opens Command Prompt in the correct folder.

   d. Type this command and press Enter:
      python -m http.server

   e. Open your web browser and go to:
      http://localhost:8000

   f. Click on `index.html` if needed, or the game may load automatically.

If you have any issues, make sure all files and folders from the zip are present and not moved around.

Enjoy the game!
